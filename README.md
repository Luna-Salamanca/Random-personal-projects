# Luna's Verified Useless Projects

Welcome to my chaotic little corner of the internet   
This monorepo is a collection of small, strange, and occasionally brilliant projects that mostly exist because... why not?

Every file here is either:
- A complete distraction
- A questionable form of therapy
- Something genius
- Or a terrible idea executed flawlessly

## Projects

## How to Run Stuff

Each project has its own folder with instructions. If it doesn't, skill issue.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer of Functionality

Some of these projects might be:

- Broken (technically speaking)
- Untested (emotionally)
- Or held together by sheer force of will

Use at your own risk. Or don't. I'm not your boss.

      <p>This chart shows the languages used across my questionable creations.</p>
      <p>It's updated automatically with every push using a GitHub Action I set up — mostly as an excuse to learn how workflows actually work.</p>
      <p>Also yes, my avatar is in the middle. You're welcome.</p>
