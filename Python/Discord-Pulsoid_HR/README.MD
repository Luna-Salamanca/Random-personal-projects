# Discord Heart Rate Bot

A simple Discord bot that displays a live heart rate in its status, using data pulled from the [Pulsoid API](https://pulsoid.net/). Includes a slash command to check your current heart rate and logs everything for analysis.

---

## Features

- Real-time heart rate updates every 10 seconds via Pulsoid API
- Bot displays the current BPM in its Discord status
- `/current_heart_rate` slash command to check the BPM in chat
- Handles offline/no data gracefully with a üíÄ icon
- Automatically logs all updates and errors to `heart_rate.log`

---

DISCORD_TOKEN = "your-discord-bot-token"
PULSOID_API_URL = "https://dev.pulsoid.net/api/v1/data/heart_rate/latest"

```

## Running the Bot

Once configured, run the bot with:

```bash
python pulsoid_hr.py
```

The bot will:
- Set its status to `{BPM} BPM ‚ù§Ô∏è` or `0 BPM üíÄ`
- Respond to `/current_heart_rate` with a live reading

---

## Example

**Bot Status:** `85 BPM ‚ù§Ô∏è`

**Slash Command Response:**
```
Current Heart Rate: 85 BPM ‚ù§Ô∏è
```

## üõ† Developer Notes

- Status updates every 10 seconds (adjustable in `await asyncio.sleep(10)`)
- If heart rate is unchanged for 1 minute or the watch goes offline, it shows `0 BPM üíÄ`
- Logs to `heart_rate.log` for debugging and historical data
